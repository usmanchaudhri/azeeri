"""
- the model accuracy will be at its best until you start using it. This phenomenon is called concept drift - the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model
	is trying to predict, change over time in unforseen ways. This causes problems because the predictions becomes less accurate as time passes.
- model monitoring is a continuous process.
- retraining or refreshing the model isn't the tricky part rather thinking of additional features that might improve the model's performance and make it more solid and accurate.
- re-fitting the static model.
