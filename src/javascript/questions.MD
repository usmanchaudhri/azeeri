# what is functional programming ?
Process of building pure functions, avoiding state sharing, mutable data, and side-effects. 
It is declarative rather than imperative, and the application state flows through pure functions,
as opposed to OOP, where the application state is typically shared and collocated with methods in objects.

# what are pure functions ?
A method in which given the same input always returns the same output with no side-effects.

# what is a pure component in react ?
A react pure component will only re-render if the props or state changes in that component. So, even if the 
parent updates re-renders, the child component may not re-render if it's state or props did not change.

# questions
* What is the difference between debounce and throttle ?
Throttle will delay executing a function. It will reduce the notifications of an event that fires multiple
times.

Debouncing will bunch a series of sequential calls to a function into a single call to that function.
it ensures that one notification is made for an event that fires multiple times.

* What is the main reason companies are moving towards React ?
* What is the difference between presentational and container components ?
Presentational components are more concerned with how things look. It may contain both presentational
and container components inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. Don't specify
the data is loaded or mutated. Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. Rarely have their own state
(when they do, it's UI state rather than data.) Examples: Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List.
