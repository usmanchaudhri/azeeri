Implement Binary heap

Binary heap is a Binary Tree with:
- It's a complete Tree.
- A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root
must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively
true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.
