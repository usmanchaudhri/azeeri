- A recommender system or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give
	to an item.
- Recommender system approaches:
- Collaborative filtering - In the newer, narrower sense, collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic
    predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste
    information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.
    A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex
    items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach[36] and the Pearson Correlation as first implemented by Allen.
- Content-based filtering - Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of
    the user's preferences. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and
    dislikes based on product features.
