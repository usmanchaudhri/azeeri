"""
Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by
collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the
collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely
to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.
