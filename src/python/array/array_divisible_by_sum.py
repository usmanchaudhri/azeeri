Question -
Check if an array can be divided into pairs whose sum is divisible by k.
Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs
such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

Input: arr[] = {9, 7, 5, 3},
k = 6
Output: True
We can divide array into (9, 3) and
(7, 5). Sum of both of these pairs
is a multiple of 6.

Note:
    - if the sum of two numbers is divisible by K than the numbers are divisible by K
    - 14 is divisible by 7, because 14 / 7 = 2 exactly
    - 15 is not divisible by 7, becuase 15 / 7 = 2(1/7) (the result is now a whole number)

Solution-1:

Solution-2:
