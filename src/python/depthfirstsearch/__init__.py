"""
Depth first Search (DFS):

Visit the root node and than visit each of root's adjacent node,
when visiting the adjacent node "K", we visit all K's adjacent
nodes before going on to root's other adjacent nodes.

- DFS can be implemented using recursion or stack.
- good with minimum use of space
- DFS is good in solving many matrix problems i.e. find path, find number of islands in matrix
