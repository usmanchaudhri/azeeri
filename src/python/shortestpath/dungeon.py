"""
You are trapped in a 2D dungeon and need to find the quickest way out! The dungeon is composed of unit
cubes which may or may not be filled with rock. It takes one minute to move one unit north, south, east
west. You cannot move diagonally and the maze is surrounded by solid rock on all sides.

Is an escape possible ?

Solution:
This is a shortest path finding problem which can be solved with backtrack using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
The dungeon is of size RxC

In this case we will use BFS
