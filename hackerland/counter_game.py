"""
Louise and Richard have developed a numbers game. They pick a number and check to see if it is a power of . If it is,
they divide it by . If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of . Whoever reduces the number
to  wins the game. Louise always starts.

Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.

As an example, let the initial value . It's Louise's turn so she first determines that  is not a power of . The next
lower power of  is , so she subtracts that from  and passes  to Richard.  is a power of , so Richard divides it by
and passes  to Louise. Likewise,  is a power so she divides it by  and reaches . She wins the game.

Update If they initially set counter to , Richard wins. Louise cannot make a move so she loses.
