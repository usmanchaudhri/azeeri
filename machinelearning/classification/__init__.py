Collaborative filtering is a technique for recommender-systems.

Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by
collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the
collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue,
A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.
A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and
therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding"
of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems.
For example, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach[36] and the Pearson Correlation as first implemented by Allen.
